Awesome — here’s a crisp, developer-ready spec for your Goals → Milestones (checklist) → Progress tracking feature. I kept it practical, so they can build straight from this.

Goals & Progress — Feature Spec (Bizzin)

1) Core Concepts
	•	Goal: A desired outcome with a title, due date, owner, and status.
	•	Milestones (Checklist items): Actionable steps under a goal. Each has its own status, optional due date, effort/weight, notes, and attachments.
	•	Progress: Auto-calculated from completed milestones (supports weighted and unweighted).
	•	Nudges: Smart reminders when milestones/goal due dates approach or slip.
	•	Activity Log: Timeline of changes for accountability and coaching.

2) UX Flows

2.1 Create a Goal
	•	Fields: Title (required), Description, Due date (required), Priority (Low/Med/High), Category/Tag(s), Visibility (Private/Team), Owner (defaults to self).
	•	Optional toggles:
	•	“Use template” (preloaded milestone sets)
	•	“Enable weighted milestones”
	•	“Auto-schedule nudges”

Acceptance: Goal saved → user lands on Goal Detail with empty checklist prompt.

2.2 Add Milestones (Checklist)
	•	Inline Add Row with [ ] checkbox, title (required), optional due date, notes, effort/weight, assignee (if team), attachments.
	•	Tap to open Milestone Drawer (edit fields + add sub-notes).
	•	Swipe left/right (mobile) → quick actions: Edit, Duplicate, Delete.

Acceptance: New item appears instantly; progress bar recalculates.

2.3 Update Progress
	•	Checking a box updates progress in real-time.
	•	Progress bar shows X of Y (and %). If weighted: Σ(weights completed)/Σ(all weights).
	•	Show Projected on-track/at-risk label based on trajectory (see Smart Nudges).

2.4 Reminders & Nudges
	•	In milestone row: “Remind me” quick set (Today PM, Tomorrow 9:00, Next week, Custom).
	•	Smart nudges (see logic below) push notifications + in-app banners.
	•	Snooze options (2h, 1 day, next Monday).

2.5 Goal Completion
	•	When all milestones complete (or user taps Mark Goal Done):
	•	Prompt: “Celebrate + Write a quick reflection?” (stores in Journal)
	•	Archive goal or keep visible (toggle “Show in Completed”).

2.6 Lists & Filters
	•	My Goals: Active | Due This Week | Overdue | Completed
	•	Sort by: Due date, Priority, Progress %, Recently updated
	•	Quick filter: With reminders today | Needs milestones | At risk

3) Data Model (lean + extendable)

3.1 Goal

{
  "id": "goal_123",
  "ownerUserId": "user_456",
  "title": "Launch podcast",
  "description": "Bizzin pilot series",
  "status": "active",            // active | completed | archived
  "priority": "high",            // low | medium | high
  "dueDate": "2025-09-30",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-16T10:12:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-08-16T10:12:00Z",
  "isWeighted": true,
  "progressPct": 40.0,           // denormalized for fast list views
  "tags": ["marketing","podcast"],
  "visibility": "private",       // private | team
  "assigneeIds": ["user_456"],   // support shared goals
  "reminderPolicy": "smart",     // off | manual | smart
  "activityLogId": "al_789"
}

3.2 Milestone

{
  "id": "ms_001",
  "goalId": "goal_123",
  "title": "Choose podcast name",
  "notes": "Short, memorable",
  "status": "done",              // todo | in_progress | done
  "dueDate": "2025-08-25",
  "weight": 2,                   // default 1; sum used when isWeighted=true
  "assigneeId": "user_456",
  "attachments": [{"id":"file_abc","name":"ideas.pdf"}],
  "reminders": [
    {"at":"2025-08-23T09:00:00+02:00","channel":"push"}
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-08-16T10:12:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-08-16T10:12:00Z",
  "orderIndex": 1
}

3.3 Activity Log (immutable append)

{
  "id": "al_789",
  "items": [
    {"ts":"2025-08-16T10:12:00Z","actor":"user_456","type":"goal_created"},
    {"ts":"2025-08-16T10:14:32Z","actor":"user_456","type":"milestone_added","milestoneId":"ms_001"}
  ]
}

4) Progress Calculation
	•	Unweighted: progress = completedMilestones / totalMilestones.
	•	Weighted: progress = sum(weight of completed) / sum(all weights).
	•	Edge cases:
	•	0 milestones → show “Add steps to start tracking” instead of 0%.
	•	Hidden/archived milestones don’t count in denominator.
	•	Partially complete (future feature): allow % at milestone level (0–100).

⸻

5) Smart Nudges (recommended defaults)

Goal-level:
	•	7 days before due: “You’re at X%. On track?” (based on slope over last 7 days)
	•	2 days before due: if <80%, mark At Risk banner.
	•	On due date + incomplete: Overdue badge + daily gentle nudge for 3 days.

Milestone-level:
	•	If milestone has its own due date: nudge 24h before and at due time.
	•	If no due date: suggest one when goal hits T–10 days.

Behavioral:
	•	Stalled detection: no activity for 5 days + not completed → “Nudge”.
	•	Momentum boost: when user completes 2+ milestones in 24h → “You’re on a roll—schedule the next one?”

Users can switch ReminderPolicy: Off | Manual | Smart.

⸻

6) Permissions & Collaboration (future-friendly)
	•	Private by default. Sharing a goal invites collaborators (view/comment or edit).
	•	Only owner can complete/archived by default (configurable).
	•	Activity log shows who changed what.

⸻

7) Integrations (nice wins)
	•	Journal: On completion, prompt a short reflection; store under “Wins”.
	•	Calendar (optional): Export milestone due dates as calendar events.
	•	Notifications: Push + email (digest option: daily 08:00 “Today’s 3 milestones”).

⸻

8) Offline & Sync
	•	Local cache for goals/milestones with optimistic updates.
	•	Conflict policy: last-write-wins + activity log diff for transparency.

⸻

9) Analytics (for you)
	•	Per-user: Goals created, completion rate, average time to complete, average milestones/goal.
	•	Funnel: Created → has milestones → progress>50% → completed.
	•	Nudge effectiveness: completion rate within 48h after nudge.
	•	Heatmaps: completion by weekday/time to tune default reminder times.

⸻

10) Error States & Edge Cases
	•	No milestones: Empty checklist state with “Add first step” template suggestions.
	•	Past due: Red badge + “Shift due date?” quick action.
	•	Too many reminders: throttle; surface a single consolidated banner.
	•	Deleted milestone: Progress recalculates; log the deletion.

⸻

11) Templates (starter packs)
	•	“Launch a podcast” → 6–10 milestones prefilled (research format, choose name, buy gear, record pilot, edit, artwork, host setup, publish, promo plan).
	•	“Hire first employee”, “File VAT return”, “Monthly management pack” (SA-context friendly).
	•	Users can save their own templates.

⸻

12) API Endpoints (example)

POST   /goals
GET    /goals?status=active&sort=dueDate
GET    /goals/{goalId}
PATCH  /goals/{goalId}
POST   /goals/{goalId}/milestones
PATCH  /milestones/{milestoneId}
DELETE /milestones/{milestoneId}
POST   /milestones/{milestoneId}/reminders
GET    /goals/{goalId}/activity


⸻

13) Minimal Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
	•	Create/edit/delete a goal with due date.
	•	Add/edit/reorder/delete milestones under a goal.
	•	Tick to complete; progress bar updates instantly.
	•	Smart nudge toggles (Off/Manual/Smart) + at least one nudge rule live.
	•	List view with filters (Active/Overdue/Completed).
	•	Activity log (basic: created, updated, completed).

⸻

14) UI Notes (mobile-first, matches your style)
	•	Goal Card: Title, due date pill, progress bar, “X/Y done”.
	•	Checklist: bordered list with clear tick boxes (your preference), drag handles for reordering, subtle sub-deadline text.
	•	Empty States: friendly copy + “use template” quick actions.
	•	Colors: neutral progress bar with success highlight at 100%. At-risk uses an amber pill; overdue uses red pill (avoid shouting).

If you want, I can package this as a one-pager PDF with the mock and this spec so you can forward it to your dev as-is.
