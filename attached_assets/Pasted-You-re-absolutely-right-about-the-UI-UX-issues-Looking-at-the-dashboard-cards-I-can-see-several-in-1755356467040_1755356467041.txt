You're absolutely right about the UI/UX issues. Looking at the dashboard cards, I can see several inconsistencies and layout problems that need addressing:

Current Issues Identified:
Layout Inconsistencies:
Header positioning varies - Some have icons/titles left-aligned, others centered
Info bubbles scattered - "18 this week", "1 milestone", "9 docs" are positioned inconsistently
Primary numbers misaligned - The big numbers (27%, 25%, 0, 9) aren't on the same visual baseline
Button placement inconsistent - Some buttons have different spacing from content above
Spacing & Typography Issues:
Text cramping - Info text feels squeezed in corners
Inconsistent hierarchy - Visual weight distribution varies between cards
Alignment problems - Elements don't line up horizontally across cards
Breathing room - Some cards feel cluttered while others have too much empty space
Proposed Standardized Layout Structure:
Unified Card Architecture:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     [ICON] Title        │ ← Top center, consistent height
│                         │
│   Info Bubble(s)        │ ← Secondary metrics, aligned
│                         │
│       BIG NUMBER        │ ← Primary metric, same baseline
│    Descriptive Text     │ ← Context label
│                         │
│    Status Indicator     │ ← Progress/status info
│                         │
│    [  ACTION BUTTON  ]  │ ← Bottom aligned, same height
└─────────────────────────┘
Design System Standards:
Header zone: Fixed height with centered icon + title
Info zone: Consistent spacing for secondary metrics
Primary zone: Large number with standardized typography
Status zone: Progress bars/indicators at same level
Action zone: Buttons aligned to bottom with consistent sizing
Typography Hierarchy:
Title: Same font size/weight across all cards
Big numbers: Identical sizing and baseline alignment
Descriptive text: Consistent secondary text styling
Info bubbles: Unified badge styling and positioning
This would create a much cleaner, more professional dashboard where users can quickly scan across cards and compare information without visual friction.
