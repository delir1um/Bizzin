Here’s a single, hand-over note you can give the Replit team. It combines **design alignment** with the **dynamic/state logic fixes** so the email always matches the user’s reality.

# Bizzin Daily Digest — Design & Dynamic Logic Feedback

## 1) Visual alignment with website

Match the “Advanced Goal Analytics” page style (clean cards, thin borders, warm orange accent).

**Brand & tokens**

* Primary accent: warm orange (use the same as the goals CTA/banner).
* Text: very dark grey for headings, mid-grey for body.
* Surfaces: white cards with a 1px light border, **rounded 10–12px**. Minimal/no shadow.
* Type: Inter (fallback Arial). Sizes: H1 24px, H2 16px, body 14px, captions 12px; line-height \~1.5.
* Spacing: 8-point rhythm; content width max 640px; 16px side padding.

**Components (email equivalents of site UI)**

* **Header:** Bizzin wordmark left, “Good {part-of-day}, {name}!” headline, date beneath in small text.
* **Quote block:** Keep it. Italic line with **orange left border** and a tiny “Your Daily Business Fuel” label. Author optional.
* **Stats row:** Four compact stat cards like the site chips. Desktop: one row; mobile: 2×2 grid.
  Labels mirror site casing: “Total Goals”, “Completed”, “In Progress”, “Success Rate” (or “Weekly Progress” if that’s your metric).
* **Primary banner:** One orange feature band (like the site hero strip) with title “Set and Track Your Business Goals”, a one-line value prop, and a primary CTA (“Start Goal Tracking →”).
* **Goal previews:** Up to 3 mini goal cards styled like the site (title, 1-line description, **thin progress bar** in orange, small chips for Priority/Category/Due date, a status pill: In Progress = orange, Completed = green, At Risk = red). End each with “View goal →”.
* **Action Items:** Three bullet actions with small arrow icons. Same verbs/site tone.
* **Smart Suggestions:** Three small info tiles (icon, bold title, one-line description, subtle arrow link) echoing the site’s bottom tiles: Goal Management, Progress Tracking, Organisation (DocSafe).
* **Journal Prompt:** As a tidy card with a pencil icon and a strong “Write your entry” CTA.
* **Business Insights:** Neutral callout card with one actionable tip and a small category chip (e.g., Growth/Finance/Operations).
* **CTAs:** Primary buttons in orange with white text, rounded corners, short labels + arrow. Secondary links in neutral text with arrows. Full-width buttons on mobile.
* **Footer:** “Open your dashboard” as the last strong CTA, then light links for Privacy / Terms / Contact. Keep “Developed by Cloudfusion” as a quiet single line.

**Accessibility & email safety**

* AA contrast on orange banner/buttons.
* Bulletproof buttons; avoid background images for critical text.
* Alt text for images/icons.
* Dark-mode safe colours (don’t rely on transparency over unknown backgrounds).

**Tone & SA English**

* Use **organise, analyse, focussed**.
* Clear, action-led verbs: **Review**, **Write**, **Explore**, **Open dashboard**.

---

## 2) Issues identified (current mailer) to rectify

* **Contradictory CTAs:** “Create your first goal” while stats show **Active Goals > 0**.
* **Journal contradiction:** “Write your first journal entry” while **Journal Entries ≥ 1**.
* **Casing inconsistency:** Mixed label casing (“Day Streak”, “Weekly progress”, etc.).
* **Vague progress metric:** Shows “Weekly Progress 75%” but copy elsewhere assumes “Success Rate”. Align metric naming.
* **Health Check tone drift:** “Needs attention” while other sections speak as if setup hasn’t started.
* **CTA redundancy:** Too many similar links; prioritise 1 primary action per block.
* **Copy not SA-localised:** Use SA English consistently.

---

## 3) Dynamic copy rules (state-aware, no contradictions)

**Inputs expected (read-only)**

* `goals.active_count` (int)
* `goals.completed_count` (int)
* `goals.in_progress_count` (int)
* `goals.success_rate_pct` or `goals.weekly_progress_pct` (0–100)
* `journal.total_entries` (int)
* `journal.week_entries` (int)
* `journal.streak_days` (int)
* `journal.last_entry_days` (int|null)
* `sentiment.available` (bool), `sentiment.label` (“Positive”|“Neutral”|“Negative”)
* `docs.count` (int)
* `focus.category` (string e.g., “Growth”)
* `user.first_name`, `now.iso_date`, `now.part_of_day`
* Optional `quote.override_text`, `quote.override_author`

**Greeting & date**

* “Good {morning/afternoon/evening}, {FirstName}!”
* Date in full: “Wednesday, 3 September 2025.”

**Quote**

* If override present → use it. Else pick deterministic “quote of the day” by date and (optionally) user seed.

**Stats labels & values**

* Show: **Total Goals**, **Completed**, **In Progress**, **Success Rate** (or **Weekly Progress** if that’s the data).
* Never display “Success Rate” if you don’t calculate it; use “Weekly Progress” instead. Keep casing consistent.

**Journal Progress card**

* If `journal.total_entries == 0` → “Create your first journal entry today.”
* Else if `journal.week_entries == 0` → “Start this week’s first entry today.”
* Else → “Keep your streak going with today’s entry.”

**Business Health Check**

* **Reflection Consistency:**

  * `week_entries == 0` → “Needs attention — 0 entries this week.”
  * `1–3` → “Getting started — {X} entries this week.”
  * `>=4` → “On track — {X} entries this week.”
* **Business Sentiment:**

  * If `!sentiment.available` OR `last_entry_days > 7` → “No recent reflections to analyse.”
  * Else → “Recent sentiment: {label}.”

**Today’s Action Items (choose top 3)**

* Goals:

  * If `goals.active_count == 0` → “Create your first goal →”
  * Else → “Review your active goals →”
* Journal:

  * If `journal.total_entries == 0` → “Write your first journal entry →”
  * Else if `journal.week_entries == 0` → “Write today’s entry →”
  * Else → “Keep the streak alive →”
* Tools: Always include “Explore BizBuilder Tools →”
* Optional DocSafe when `docs.count == 0` → “Secure your key documents with DocSafe →”

**Goal previews section (up to 3 cards)**

* If `goals.active_count == 0` → Hide previews, show an orange **“Start Goal Tracking →”** banner.
* Else → show 1–3 most relevant goals (prioritise `At Risk`, then `In Progress`, then nearest due).

  * Status pill mapping:

    * Completed → green pill, progress 100%
    * In Progress → orange pill, progress >0 & <100
    * At Risk (your logic) → red pill, progress bar still shows current %

**Smart Suggestions**

* **Document Management**

  * `docs.count == 0` → “Organise important business documents with secure DocSafe storage.”
  * `>0` → “Add tags and expiry reminders to stay audit-ready in DocSafe.”
* **Goal-setting framework**

  * Show if `goals.active_count < 3` OR `success/weekly_progress_pct < 60`.

**Journal Prompt**

* Always show a single prompt.
* If `streak_days == 0` → append “Start a 2-day streak this week.”

**Business Insights**

* If `success/weekly_progress_pct < 100` → insight about breaking goals into smaller milestones.
* If `focus.category` present → append “You’re heavily **focussed on {category}** — check if this balance fits your priorities.”

**Buttons & labels (stateful)**

* Goals CTA: `Create your first goal` | `Review your active goals`
* Journal CTA: `Write your first entry` | `Write today’s entry` | `Keep the streak alive`
* DocSafe: `Explore DocSafe` | `Add documents`
* Global: `Open your dashboard`

**Localisation**

* SA English: organise, analyse, focussed, programme (if used), licence, etc.
* Date format: `D MMMM YYYY` (e.g., 3 September 2025).

---

## 4) Edge cases & fallbacks

* **Brand-new user:** All counts 0 → emphasise setup: first goal, first journal, DocSafe intro. Hide stats that would read 0% success unless you can explain it.
* **All goals completed:** Replace goal previews with a celebratory line + “Create a new goal”.
* **No sentiment data:** Always show “No recent reflections to analyse.”
* **Dark mode:** Ensure orange buttons stay legible; don’t invert to low contrast.
* **Email client limitations:** Don’t rely on background images; progress bars should degrade gracefully (e.g., a solid colour bar inside a bordered container).

---

## 5) QA checklist before shipping

* **No contradictions** in copy given the user state (especially “first goal/entry” vs counts).
* **Casing and labels** match site (“In Progress”, “Completed”, “At Risk”).
* **Metrics alignment:** If you show “Success Rate”, it is actually computed; otherwise show “Weekly Progress”.
* **Visual parity:** Cards, chips, pills, progress bar style match the site’s look and feel.
* **Responsive:** Desktop one-row stats; mobile 2×2; buttons full-width on mobile.
* **Accessibility:** AA contrast; button/tap targets ≥ 44px on mobile; alt text present.
* **Tracking:** CTAs consistently tagged (UTM/source).
* **Quote:** Deterministic per day (and user seed) unless overridden.

This gives the devs both the **design direction** to mirror the site and the **state rules** to keep the content smart and contradiction-free.
