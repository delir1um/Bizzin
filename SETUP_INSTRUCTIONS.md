# ðŸš€ DocSafe Setup Instructions

## Database Setup Required

To enable the DocSafe document management system, you need to set up the database and storage:

### 1. Create Database Tables

Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects) â†’ SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Run the complete SQL from create-docsafe-database.sql
-- This creates the documents and folders tables with proper RLS policies
```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** section in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Set bucket name: `documents`
4. Set as **Private** (not public)
5. Click **Create bucket**

### 3. Set Up Storage Policies

In the SQL Editor, run these storage policies:

```sql
-- Enable upload for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Enable upload for authenticated users" ON storage.objects 
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Enable read for users on their files  
CREATE POLICY "Enable read for users on their files" ON storage.objects 
    FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Enable delete for users on their files
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for users on their files" ON storage.objects 
    FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```
