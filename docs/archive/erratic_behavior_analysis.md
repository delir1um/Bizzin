# Erratic Behavior Analysis - Session 21:09:43

## Critical Issues Discovered:

### 1. **Goal Type Inconsistency** ðŸš¨ MAJOR ISSUE
**What Happened:**
- User created goal as "Manual Test" (implied manual type)
- But the saved goal shows `"progress_type":"milestone"` in database
- This is a **data consistency problem**!

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
Goal updated successfully: {
  "title": "Manual Test",
  "progress_type": "milestone"  <-- Wrong type!
}
```

### 2. **Missing UI Form Field Tracking** ðŸš¨ CRITICAL
**What's Missing:**
- No logs for form field changes (title, description, etc.)
- Only seeing form_submit event, not individual field changes
- User interactions with form fields are invisible

**Expected but Missing:**
```
[GOAL_UPDATE] field: "title", old_value: "", new_value: "Manual Test"
[GOAL_UPDATE] field: "description", old_value: "", new_value: "Test Description"
```

### 3. **Goal Type Dropdown Not Logged** ðŸš¨ CRITICAL
**Issue:** No logs of goal type selection/changes
- User may have selected one type but got another
- Can't see if dropdown is working correctly
- No conversion dialog interactions logged

### 4. **Form State Management Issue**
**Pattern:** Goal saves with wrong progress_type
- Form shows one thing, database stores another
- Suggests form state is not properly synchronized
- Default fallback may be overriding user selection

## Root Cause Analysis:

### A. **Progress Type Not Being Set from Form**
The form submission is missing `progress_type` field in updates:

```javascript
const updates = {
  title: formData.title,
  description: formData.description,
  // Missing: progress_type: formData.progress_type
}
```

### B. **Form Field Handlers Not Connected**
The `handleFormDataChange` function exists but form fields still use old `setFormData` directly:

```javascript
// Wrong (still in code):
onChange={(e) => setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, deadline: e.target.value }))}

// Should be:
onChange={(e) => handleFormDataChange('deadline', e.target.value)}
```

### C. **Default Progress Type Override**
Database may have default that overrides form selection, causing inconsistency.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:

### 1. **Form State Synchronization** âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: Form fields not properly tracked, causing data loss
- **Solution**: Connected all form fields to `handleFormDataChange`
- **Impact**: Now every field change is logged and tracked

### 2. **Progress Type Missing from Updates** âœ… FIXED  
- **Problem**: `progress_type` wasn't included in form submission
- **Solution**: Added `progress_type: formData.progress_type` to updates object
- **Impact**: Goal type selection now persists correctly

### 3. **Comprehensive Field Tracking** âœ… ENABLED
- **Fixed Fields**: title, description, category, priority, status, deadline, progress
- **Result**: Every user interaction now logged with before/after values

## Expected Results After Fixes:
1. **Consistent Goal Types**: Selected type matches saved type
2. **Complete Change Tracking**: See all form field modifications in logs
3. **Reliable Data Persistence**: Form state properly synced with database
4. **Better Error Detection**: Immediate visibility into any remaining issues

## Next Test Recommendations:
1. Create a goal and explicitly select "Regular Goal" - verify it saves as `manual`
2. Create a goal and select "Milestone-Based Goal" - verify it saves as `milestone` 
3. Edit a goal and change its type - verify conversion works properly
4. Monitor debug panel for complete form interaction logs
