# Sample Entry Analysis Summary

Based on console logs, here's what I observed from the recent AI analysis:

## Console Log Analysis Results:

### ✅ Working Correctly:
1. **Talent Loss Detection** → `Challenge/Worried/low (93%)` ✓
2. **Budget Planning** → `Planning/Thoughtful/medium (95%)` ✓ 
3. **Product Launch** → `Achievement/Proud/high (95%)` ✓
4. **Market Expansion** → Various results

### ❌ Still Issues:
1. **Team Expansion**: Rule matched `HIRING_COMPLETED` → `Growth/Excited/high (95%)`
   - Issue: Should be Planning, not Growth for strategy sessions
   - The new rule is triggering but with wrong categorization

2. **Customer Feedback**: Getting `Learning/Thoughtful/medium (45%)`
   - Low confidence suggests pattern matching needs improvement

## Expected vs Actual:

**Target Accuracy Goals:**
- Major client deal → Achievement/Excited/high (90%+) ✓
- Supply chain → Challenge/Frustrated/medium (95%) ✓
- Team expansion → Planning/Thoughtful/medium (should be 90%+) ❌ Currently Growth/Excited
- Customer feedback → Learning/Thoughtful/medium (should be 85%+) ❌ Currently 45%
- Algorithm breakthrough → Achievement/Proud/high (95%) ✓
- Difficult conversation → Challenge/Worried/low (93%) ✓

## Current Score: 4/6 = 67% → Need to reach 85%+ target

The system shows high confidence (93-95%) when rules match correctly, but categorization logic needs refinement.
