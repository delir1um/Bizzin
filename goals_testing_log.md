**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Testing Method**: 20 Real Business Scenarios  
**Following**: Development Methodology Phase 1

## Testing Plan
Creating 20 authentic entrepreneur goals to identify actual usability issues:

### Goal Categories Being Tested:

2. **Product Development** - Feature launches, technical milestones
3. **Team Building** - Hiring, culture development
4. **Customer Success** - Satisfaction scores, churn reduction
5. **Growth** - User acquisition, market expansion
6. **Technical** - Infrastructure, compliance, optimization
7. **Business Development** - Partnerships, funding
8. **Operations** - Cost reduction, process improvement

## Test Results

### Testing Started: 7:25 PM
**Current Status**: Beginning systematic testing of Goals feature with real business scenarios

### UI/UX Issues Discovered:

#### Goal Creation Experience:
- **ISSUE FOUND #1**: Schema Mismatch - Database schema defines status as ('active', 'completed', 'paused', 'cancelled') but UI uses ('not_started', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'on_hold', 'at_risk')
- **Impact**: This could cause database errors when saving goals with UI statuses
- **Testing**: Creating goals with complex business descriptions and real metrics
- **Focus**: Form validation, date handling, progress tracking setup

#### Progress Tracking:
- **Testing**: Goals with specific target values (MRR $10K, 1000 users, 95% satisfaction)
- **Focus**: Numeric targets vs percentage progress, tracking accuracy

#### Filtering & Search:
- **Testing**: Business categories, priority levels, status filtering
- **Focus**: Search functionality with business terminology

#### Status Management:
- **ISSUE FOUND #2**: Status value inconsistency between schema and UI implementation
- **FIXED**: Updated shared/schema.ts to match UI status values and field names
- **Action**: Running database schema update via npm run db:push
- **Testing**: Real project statuses (in_progress, at_risk, not_started)
- **Focus**: Status transitions, deadline management

#### Database Schema Updates:
- **FIXED**: Aligned Goal type with UI implementation (status values, deadline field naming)
- **FIXED**: Updated createGoalSchema validation to match UI requirements
- **Action**: Database push in progress to align backend with frontend
